# Using EPoll with Multiple Threads

---

# EPoll is Super Awesome



### Scalable file descriptor event notification
### Register your interest in a file descriptor and the kernel lets you know when stuff happens.
### Used for all that fancy 'event loop' stuff like node.js has
### [libuv](https://github.com/joyent/libuv) uses epoll as a backend on linux


---

# Why use EPoll

### Rad Performance
### No seriously, EPoll and its equivalents such as kqueue are super fast.
### Used for many projects that need absurd performance
* libuv (Used in Node js)
* Nginx
* Gevent (python), uses libev, which is built on epoll/kqueue

---

# Why use EPoll with multiple threads?

### Usually you don't
### Except if you are handling a DDOS attack (or a ton of legit traffic)
* Like being slashdotted

### In my case the [Ultimate Victory Battle](https://github.com/rossdylan/uvb-server)
### UVB is a game, someone makes a server, everyone else tries to break it

---

# How it works

### EPoll works by having the kernel alert your program when something changes on a set of file descriptors.
### You can make a new EPoll instance like so

```c
#include <sys/epoll.h>
#include <errno.h>

int epoll_fd;
if((epoll_fd = epoll_create1(0)) == -1) {
    perror("epoll_create");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```

### This returns a file descriptor which is used to control epoll
---

# Adding File Descriptors to an EPoll set

```c
typedef struct {
    int fd;
    int otherThing;
} Data;

struct epoll_event event;

// event.data.ptr how you attach some persistent data to a fd in epoll
if((event.data.ptr = malloc(sizeof(Data))) == NULL) {
    perror("malloc");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
// we are going to assume that socket_fd is an open fd
event.events = EPOLLIN | EPOLLET;
if((epoll_ctl(epoll_fd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, socket_fd, &event)) == -1) {
    perror("epoll_create");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```

---

# Wait? What did we just do?
### we added a persistant struct to an event

```
event.data.ptr = malloc(sizeof(Data))
```

### We set how we want to receive events, and what events to receive.

```
event.events = EPOLLIN | EPOLLET;
```

### Finally we added a socket file descriptor to the epoll set and link it with the event we created.

```
epoll_ctl(epoll_fd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, socket_fd, &event)
```

---

# What about EPOLLIN | EPOLLET?

### EPOLLIN is used to tell epoll that we want to be notified when there is data ready to be read
* There is also an EPOLLOUT Used to notify us when a file descriptor is ready for writing
### EPOLLET stands for EPoll Edge Triggered
* This changes EPoll to return from epoll_wait whenever a fd changes status.
* Must be used in conjunction with nonblocking sockets

---

# Actually using epoll

```c
// An array of events
struct epoll_event *events;
// A single event we use as scratch space
struct epoll_event event;

events = calloc(MAXEVENTS, sizeof(struct epoll_event))
int n;
while (1) {
    n = epoll_wait(kepoll_fd, events, MAXEVENTS, -1);
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        Data dat = (Data *)events[i].data.ptr;
        if(events[i].events & EPOLLIN) {
            /**
            Read from dat->fd
            */
        }
    }
}
```

---

# Wat?

### Make a persistent array to store events

```c
events = calloc(MAXEVENTS, sizeof(struct epoll_event))
```

### Grab the struct we attached to this fd

```c
Data dat = (Data *)events[i].data.ptr;
```

### Check if we have a EPOLLIN event (there is data to read from this fd)

```c
if(events[i].events & EPOLLIN)
```

### And then you read like you would normally

---

# Lets talk about EPoll with Multiple Threads

### Since we are moving to use multiple threads we need to change a few things

### Most of what we are changing involves making epoll_wait behave across multiple threads.

### The first thing we need to change is how we add fds to epoll.
```c
event.events = EPOLLIN | EPOLLET | EPOLLONESHOT;
```

---

# What is EPOLLONESHOT

### EPOLLONESHOT is an option that disables a file descriptor inside of epoll once an event has been given out via epoll_wait.

### The only way to re-enable a fd is to use epoll_ctl with EPOLL_CTL_MOD
```c
// Reset what we are watching for
events[i].events = EPOLLIN | EPOLLET | EPOLLONESHOT;
// tell epoll to re-enable this fd.
epoll_ctl(epoll_fd, EPOLL_CTL_MOD, dat->fd, &events[i])
```

---

# Why do we do this?

### Ensure each event is handled exactly once
### Its easy to wind up with deadlocks and race conditions
### EPOLLONESHOT makes it easier to avoid these things

---

# What does this give me?

### Typical EPoll uses a single thread
### Modern computers have way more than 1 CPU (usually)
### Lets use a computers resources to the max!
